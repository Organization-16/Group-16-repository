Known bugs:
	- Search doesn't allow names with symbols in them, e.g. Blue-berried Honeysuckle (hyphen)
	- 

Troubleshooting:
	- To find a plant name quickly open the scroll window then begin typing the plant you are looking for


Notes:
	-Images are saved on the web server, rather than the database, and the database only holds information for the location of them
